## Guidelines  

**Goal:** to obtain a clear estimation of each components by working only with the final signal  

- Analyse the final signal: stationary or non-stationary  
- Run a FFT analysis to get an idea of the frequency components. Reflect on the results of this analysis  
- How to decide the window size if STFT or WT is going to be used?  
- Which signal processing technique is best for your signal (FFT, STFT, WVT, WT, HT)?  
- Add an offset and repeat the analysis  
- Add white noise and repeat the analysis  
- Add a linearly time varying frequency component (kt)  
- Add an offset and white noise and repeat the analysis
